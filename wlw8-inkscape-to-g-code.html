tl;dr: 1. Given that we'd be making playhouse kits with the CNC and then selling those kits, and that Habitat for Humanity is a well known non-profit, would we still be legal for using Fusion 360 free, or should i stick to inkscape (or some other software)? (more on software thoughts in the "other thoughts" section) 2. Is Inkscape good enough for just making through-cut parts from plywood, or is there another option that is more recommended. I know I'll need CAM software if I go the inkscape. Congratulations, you machine is under its own power. By now you have spent some time jogging the machine around using the keyboard or the buttons on Universal G-Code Sender. I would try Inkscape stamp gcodetools, or Inkscape stamp Gcode tools, or maybe Inkscape engrave gcodetools, or Inkscape engrave Gcode tools, or maybe Inkscape gcodetools tutorial, or Inkscape Gcode tools tutorial, or Inkscape engrave Gcode tools tutorials Sadly the world of CAM/CNC is dominated by proprietary software which costs hobbyists and students a lot. Besides for scientists and researchers they do not provide much freedom to tinker around. I have previously listed all the available CAD options here (https://www.reddit.com/r/cad/comments/8dmtc8/please_share_your_experience_with_the_available/) or if you are interested in indirect code based design here (https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/2299). I'm going to just list everything. In Inkscape, rounding the corners of a rectangle is easy - you select the object, press F4 (rectangle tool), and drag the circular nodes. How do you do that for more complex shapes. Here's an interesting link to a page showing how to use inkscape and a plugin to create g-code. It worked for me. http://wiki.linuxcnc.org/cgi-bin/emc. 
# Essential Software for Windows 10 This is a list of software I found useful. This list is designed around Windows 10; many of these should work with older Windows, Linux distros, and Mac. This is a list of software I've personally tried and tested, there may be better ones out there so keep your calm when your favorite software isn't featured. Suggestions are always welcomed. This is my last post on /r/software, form now on I'll maintain a repo to keep this list updated. Message Paisley designs are immensely popular and widely used in fabric design, stationery designs and the like. I was working on a stationery design and decided that I might as well write a tutorial on how to create paisley patterns with Inkscape. Attention When Inkscape calculates dimensions it includes stroke width in width and height.  The author recommends to draw in px and then select the units in the G-Code Plugin. I prefer to view my drawing in inches since that is what my machine is configured. if you gonna downvote, explain why. I'd like to share my experience going 100% Linux few months ago, I think we (advanced users) need to share the experience to encourage others to do the same, is possible, we can get out of windows OSes, Is not the same is not perfect, but I think is necessary, and is possible for mostly everyone. Is something that was in my mind for a long time, one of the main issues few month ago was the GPU, I had a R9 280x it has a poor performance, both drivers crash. I've traced an image: Now I'd like to create an outline around the image that is a bit wider stroke. I've tried Path > Trace Bitmap but it doesn't do anything.

Hi. I'm a reactor physicist/technical engineering manager in the US advanced reactor business. A lot of people ask me what they should do to prep for a nuclear design job. Along the way, I realized that while the reactor part of education is fairly obvious, the computer side is less clear. So I independently wrote an e-book tour of various (almost all open-source) tools that I've learned through the years and have been able to leverage towards reactor design. I added some bonus stuff in there. Inkscape is a Free and Open Source vector drawing program oriented towards the creation of SVG (scalable vector graphics). It can export to DXF for use in other CAD/CAM software, or directly to G-code using the Gcodetools extension. I'm thinking about migrating from arch to gentoo but a couple of things i have to ask someone before. The portage package manager have problem with packages who aren't ported to gentoo? Example: I use franz to manage my social media. Someone use franz on gentoo? It's there a way to install him on gentoo? (Because on arch he is a ported deb by the users and installed by arch user repository. And on their site they have only a deb and a AppImage) Visual studio code, unity, veracrypt, metaspl. Okay, so sometimes I see some misunderstandings about Flatpak going around, and this interesting page ( unfortunately has not done much to help. I figured I'd take a brief moment to try and give a bit of an explanation of how exactly it works and why it's even a thing. ## Portability I'm not going to bother with this too much, since I think everyone knows this is one of Flatpak's main points. However, I've seen some people say that distro packaging helps improve security.

Looking for a good lightweight OS I installed Neverware's CloudReady operating system on both and it ran like an absolute dream. All hardware was supported, it was fast, the interface was slick. The operating system even allowed the installation of Flatpak files from Flathub which allowed me to install my favorite Linux applications like Gimp, Inkscape I've also found that gcode file for the simple rectangle mentioned above, contains >6000 lines of code I hav't looked at in detail, .

So I got a glowforge that was originally scheduled for an early January 2019 delivery, but it ended up coming in before Christmas.

Now I'm diving into designing my own stuff using inkscape which has definitely had a learning curve but now I am totally thrilled I got turned onto Thinkpad by a friend when he heard my criteria for my ideal laptop, and Im hoping some of you may have advice on searching for one, and set up.

Hi David, YES your assistance would be most welcomed re T2L. I must admit to having read some excellent reviews of this product, & if it is as good as it sounds, the it will be worth the money The reasoning being if you type "free", generally you will be advertised to or get the LITE version which will only have some of the functionality and then will be up-sold to. Open source does what it says on the tin - the code is open for anyone to examine and even adapt and is usually available in-full for free, occasionally accepting donations if you are so inclined.
