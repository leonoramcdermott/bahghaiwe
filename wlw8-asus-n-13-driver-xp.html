I spent a long time deciding between the two laptops, and no one on /r/laptops or /r/SuggestALaptop gave me a concrete answer as to which laptop is better. I decided to go with the HP Spectre X360 because it was 0 cheaper, had an all metal build, has a 2in1 functionality, comes with a USB\-C to HDMI adapter, has a USB\-A port, the new HP logo looks cool, and felt like I could trust HP since they're the #1 PC manufacturer in the world. Huge mistake. There are so many flaws with the HP Spectre.

This is where I really struggle. I've been a Mac user for years. I hate the thought of switching to Windows.
