OK I'm a little loaded after fiddling with Ubuntu Touch for a weekend. I can understand there's no usable replacement for Whatsapp and Hangouts. That's fine, it's not Canonicals fault. What I can't wrap my head around is several technical problems. FWIW, I have a BQ Aquaris E5, running Touch 15.04 (OTA-9). When I change from mobile data to WiFi and vice versa, I need to switch to airplane mode and back for IP communication to work. Seems like the network link does not become operational. 
Hi all, first off apologies if this is the wrong place to ask this, please redirect me if it is! I'm currently volunteering at a local community group where I'm running an informal photography session once a week. I'm teaching complete beginners the very basics of how to take photos with whatever they have - cheap compact cameras, old SLRs, mobile phones. They're a mixed group, all ages, mostly with social/mental/physical problems, and a lovely bunch. This week I want to talk with them about. I have tried Plex & Google Photos but neither meets all my requirements: - I want to be able to put photos in multiple albums at once - Face recognition & sorting is a plus point, but I want to be able to add pictures manually too, which makes Google Photos feature useless for me. - I want to be able to access my photos offline, at least from PC, but ideally also from my android phone. - A big plus would also be the ability to go through the photos in windows explorer NetGuard is a local-VPN based firewall (doesn't require any remote VPN server). It can allow/deny network requests from applications based on the HTTP/S URLs. Its rules are not based on solely on host name or IP address. I'm looking for similar software, but for Window platform. I plan to dual boot my laptop with Windows and Ubuntu. The reasoning for Windows is because many games aren't available on Linux, so I will be using Windows for whenever I want to game. I plan to use as much open source and privacy focused software on Windows, but the one thing I can't find is security software. All I can find is ClamWin, which is an on demand scanner and that's it. Furthermore its detection rate isn't the greatest. There is Immunet which uses ClamAV, but Immunet itself isn't.

The main crux is to measure time taken to complete a project in total, plus measure time taken with individual tasks and to measure work hours of each individual worker.
